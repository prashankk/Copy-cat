        <p>ABOUT <br> <br>
            Creating my first webpage was an exciting and challenging journey that marked a pivotal moment in my tech journey. I began with the basics, exploring HTML to structure the page and CSS to bring it to life with color and style. The project wasn’t just about the final look; it was a hands-on introduction to essential coding concepts and problem-solving skills. I learned to link different elements, style images, and understand responsive design, ensuring the page looked good on various devices. Every detail felt like a small victory, and the satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life kept me motivated. <br>

            A huge thanks to the Codegenweb YouTube channel, which played a crucial role in guiding me through the tough spots. Their tutorials were clear, beginner-friendly, and insightful, making complex concepts easy to understand and apply. From positioning layouts to responsive design tips, Codegenweb’s videos provided just the right guidance, helping me troubleshoot and experiment with new techniques. This project became not only a webpage but a milestone in my learning journey. It built my confidence in coding and sparked my enthusiasm for web development, setting a strong foundation for more projects to come.</p>
